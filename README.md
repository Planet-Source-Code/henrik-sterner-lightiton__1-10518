### Description

This is a little mind (and math) game. You need to light a area of 5*5 boxes with a special figure. It may sound a little bit odd but don't worry: When you begin it's very easy!

The game also include a solution-finder. The solution finder simply runs through the combinations (total: 2^25=33554432) until it finds a solution.
 
### More Info
 
The source-code should be easy to understand and it also includes some god ideas if you are trying to make a chess(with a brain) game (arrays, "algoritm").
